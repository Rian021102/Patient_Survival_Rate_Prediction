# Patient_Survival_Rate_Prediction
Machine Learning Model to Predict Survival of Patients
## Project Description
This project is meant to provide physicians a predictive model to predict chance of survival of patients admissioned in hospital after 1 year treatment
## Problem Background
A hospital in the province of Greenland has been trying to improve its care conditions by looking at historic survival of the patients. They tried looking at their data but could not identify the main factors leading to high survivals
## Project Objective
Develop a model that will predict the chances of survival of a patient after 1 year of treatment (Survived_1_year).
## Accuaracy
The Accuracy of Prediction scored by F1-Score is more than 85%
